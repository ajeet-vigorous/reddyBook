                                                        Our's non-runner rule relates to the adjustment of odds-on bets already matched when a horse in a race is declared a non-runner. Toadjust We apply a reduction factor to the remaining runners. The reduction factor allocated to a non-runner is a calculation (the details of which are described below) of that horse's chances of winning (or being placed, etc as appropriate) and is applied to bets already matched on the other runners in the relevant market or markets.

                                                        Any horse listed when the relevant market is loaded which does not subsequently come under the starter's orders is deemed to be a non-runner.

                                                        When the market is loaded each horse is given a 'reduction factor, based on a forecast price, which is expressed as a percentage. These reduction factors may be updated periodically at the discretion of the Us based on trading in the market, but after approximately 15 minutes (approximately 5 minutes for Australian and US markets) from the scheduled 'off' time of a given race, they will be updated only in exceptional circumstances. The current reduction factor percentage for each horse can be viewed on the 'info' page on Our website or by asking the Helpdesk.

                                                        Accurate reduction factors will only be applied to selections in the event of a non-runner. Once a non-runner is declared each selection in the market will be given an appropriate reduction factor. Reduction factors can be amended at Ourâ€™s discretion at any time throughout the market life cycle (including post-race).

                                                        For Australian racing, reduction factors may be updated periodically at the discretion of the Us based on trading in the market, but after approximately five minutes from the scheduled off time of a given race, they will be updated only in exceptional circumstances.

                                                        As soon as We become aware that a horse is an official non-runner or a highly likely non-runner, following a statement to the press from connections, the following will happen:

If the non-runners reduction factor is less than 2.5%, reductions will not be applied and unmatched bets will not be cancelled.

                                                        Reduction factors are not applied to bets which are struck in play. However, if a market is turned in-play prematurely by error (or, for example, there is a false start), all bets matched during this time will be subject to any later reduction factor, provided the market is turned out of play before the race commences. In the event of a late withdrawal, wereserve the right to remove the runner after the completion of the race. In this case, only those bets matched before the off will be affected by a reduction factor.

All bets made between the time of withdrawal and reinstatement will be void in both the place market and the win market. The reduction factor applied to matched bets at the time of withdrawal will be reversed and the original prices will become valid.

If We become aware of more than one non-runner at the same time, it will remove the non-runners from the relevant markets in race card order.

                                                        If a runner is not included in a market because of an error or because of incorrect information regarding a runnerâ€™s participation, we reserve the right to introduce the missing runner into the market at any time before settlement (even after the race has been run), provided that We are determined that the missing runner is not a material runner (i.e., a selection with a reduction factor of approx. 2.5% or less in the win market). In such circumstances, all pre-play unmatched and matched bets will stand, however, if the runner is not introduced before the start of the race, all in-play bets will be void. However, if the missing runner is deemed to be a material runner, then the malformed market will be void and a new market will be loaded where possible.

                                                        In the win market, reductions will be made on the traded price. For example: if the non-runners final reduction factor is 25% the traded price on all previously matched bets on other horses will be reduced by 25% - the traded price of 8.0 would become 6.0 etc. And these might be further reduced if another horse is subsequently declared a non-runner.

                                                        In the EW Market, reductions will be made on the traded win price. The advertised place terms will then apply to the revised win prices. For example: if the non-runners final reduction factor is 25% the traded price on all previously matched bets on other horses will be reduced by 25% - - the traded price of 8.0 would become 6.0. If each Way terms were 1/5th odds for 3 places, the corresponding price for the Place portion of the bet would reduce from 2.4 to 2.0.

                                                        In the place market, reductions will be made to the potential winnings on the bet only, and not the traded price. For example: if the non-runners final reduction factor is 25% the potential winnings on all previously matched bets on the other horses will be reduced by 25% - a traded price of 8.0 would become 6.25. For example, a Â£10 bet on a horse to be placed at a traded price of 8.0 would provide winnings of Â£70. If there is a non-runner with a reduction factor of 25% in the race, that factor will be applied to the Â£70 of potential winnings leaving potential winnings of Â£52.50. Therefore, the revised traded price will be 6.25.

                                                        The traded price may be further reduced if any other horse(s) is subsequently declared a non-runner, however, odds cannot be reduced below 1.01.

                                                        For the avoidance of doubt, any reduction factor applicable to a non-runner replaced by a reserve will be applied to all bets struck on the relevant markets, before the removal from those markets of such non-runner by Us. Likewise, should a reserve runner become a confirmed runner but subsequently become a non-runner, any reduction factor applicable to such non-runner will be applied to all bets struck on the relevant markets, before the removal from those markets of such non-runner by Us.
